  abstract = {Gaussian random fields with Mat\textbackslash 'ern covariance functions are popular models in spatial statistics and machine learning. In this work, we develop a spatio-temporal extension of the Gaussian Mat\textbackslash 'ern fields formulated as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation. The spatially stationary subset of the models have marginal spatial Mat\textbackslash 'ern covariances, and the model also extends to Whittle-Mat\textbackslash 'ern fields on curved manifolds, and to more general non-stationary fields. In addition to the parameters of the spatial dependence (variance, smoothness, and practical correlation range) it additionally has parameters controlling the practical correlation range in time, the smoothness in time, and the type of non-separability of the spatio-temporal covariance. Through the separability parameter, the model also allows for separable covariance functions. We provide a sparse representation based on a finite element approximation, that is well suited for statistical inference and which is implemented in the R-INLA software.},

Their main challenge focusses around computation, but the advent of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and in particular of the WinBUGS software has opened the doors of Bayesian modelling to the wide research community. However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint. Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method. In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data.},

The differential operator is given by the fractional power \$L\^\textbackslash beta \$, \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash in (0,1)\$ of an integer-order elliptic differential operator \$L\$ and is therefore nonlocal. Its inverse \$L\^\{-\textbackslash beta \}\$ is represented by a Bochner integral from the Dunford–Taylor functional calculus. By applying a quadrature formula to this integral representation the inverse fractional-order operator \$L\^\{-\textbackslash beta \}\$ is approximated by a weighted sum of nonfractional resolvents \$( I + \textbackslash exp(2 y\_\textbackslash ell) \textbackslash, L )\^\{-1\}\$ at certain quadrature nodes \$t\_j\&gt; 0\$. The resolvents are then discretized in space by a standard finite element method. This approach is combined with an approximation of the white noise, which is based only on the mass matrix of the finite element discretization. In this way an efficient numerical algorithm for computing samples of the approximate solution is obtained. For the resulting approximation the strong mean-square error is analyzed and an explicit rate of convergence is derived. Numerical experiments for \$L=\textbackslash kappa \^2-\textbackslash Delta \$, \$\textbackslash kappa\&gt; 0\$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit cube \$(0,1)\^d\$ in \$d=1,2,3\$ spatial dimensions for varying \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash in (0,1)\$ attest to the theoretical results.},

  abstract = {A popular approach for modeling and inference in spatial statistics is to represent Gaussian random fields as solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of the form Lβu=W , where W is Gaussian white noise, L is a second-order differential operator, and β{$>$}0 is a parameter that determines the smoothness of u. However, this approach has been limited to the case 2β∈N , which excludes several important models and makes it necessary to keep β fixed during inference. We propose a new method, the rational SPDE approach, which in spatial dimension d∈N is applicable for any β{$>$}d/4 , and thus remedies the mentioned limitation. The presented scheme combines a finite element discretization with a rational approximation of the function x−β to approximate u. For the resulting approximation, an explicit rate of convergence to u in mean-square sense is derived. Furthermore, we show that our method has the same computational benefits as in the restricted case 2β∈N . Several numerical experiments and a statistical application are used to illustrate the accuracy of the method, and to show that it facilitates likelihood-based inference for all model parameters including β.Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider a hierarchical spatio-temporal model for particulate matter (PM) concentration in the North-Italian region Piemonte. The model involves a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by a measurement error, and a state process characterized by a first order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. This kind of model is well discussed and widely used in the air quality literature thanks to its flexibility in modelling the effect of relevant covariates (i.e. meteorological and geographical variables) as well as time and space dependence. However, Bayesian inference—through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques—can be a challenge due to convergence problems and heavy computational loads. In particular, the computational issue refers to the infeasibility of linear algebra operations involving the big dense covariance matrices which occur when large spatio-temporal datasets are present. The main goal of this work is to present an effective estimating and spatial prediction strategy for the considered spatio-temporal model. This proposal consists in representing a GF with Matérn covariance function as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) through the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approach. The main advantage of moving from a GF to a GMRF stems from the good computational properties that the latter enjoys. In fact, GMRFs are defined by sparse matrices that allow for computationally effective numerical methods. Moreover, when dealing with Bayesian inference for GMRFs, it is possible to adopt the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm as an alternative to MCMC methods giving rise to additional computational advantages. The implementation of the SPDE approach through the R-library INLA (www.r-inla.org) is illustrated with reference to the Piemonte PM data. In particular, providing the step-by-step R-code, we show how it is easy to get prediction and probability of exceedance maps in a reasonable computing time.},

As part of the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) (www.oceantrackingnework.org) acoustic tags known as VEMCO Mobile Transceivers (VMTs) (www.vemco.com) are being deployed on Sable Island grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in order to record instances of proximity to each other (as well as any other acoustically tagged animals). The seals essentially become bioprobes yielding data exhibiting both spatial and temporal variation. Fortunately, recent developments in the field of spatial statistics have greatly facilitated the fitting of complex spatial and spatio-temporal models. Here we specifically propose a hierarchical spatio-temporal model framework and fit it to these data using both Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) through R-INLA (www.r-inla.org). In so doing we demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of these techniques. These methods readily extend to spatially explicit data collected by any sort of mobile receiving platform (e.g. wave gliders, remotely operated underwater vehicles).},

Here we establish integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) as two powerful tools for modelling patterns of bycatch through time and space. These novel, computationally fast approaches are applied to fit zero-inflated hierarchical spatiotemporal models to Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) bycatch data from the Baffin Bay Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) gillnet fishery. Results indicate that Greenland shark bycatch is clustered in space and time, varies significantly from year to year, and there are both tractable factors (number of gillnet panels, total Greenland halibut catch) and physical features (bathymetry) leading to the high incidence of Greenland shark bycatch. Bycatch risk could be reduced by limiting access to spatiotemporal hotspots or by establishing a maximum number of panels per haul. Our method explicitly models the spatiotemporal correlation structure inherent in bycatch data at a very reasonable computational cost, such that the forecasting of bycatch patterns and simulating conservation strategies becomes more accessible.},

  abstract = {The extent of fires, their periodicity and their impact on terrestrial communities have been a major concern in the last century. Wildfires play an important role in shaping landscapes and as a source of CO2 and particulate matter, contributing to the green house effect and to global warming. Modeling the spatial variability of wildfire extent is therefore an important subject in order to understand and to predict future trends on their effect in landscape changes and global warming. The most common approaches have been through point pattern analysis or by Markov random fields. Those methods have made possible to build risk maps, but for many forest managers knowing the fire size besides the location of the fire is very useful. In this work we use spatial marked point processes to model the fire size of the forest fires observed in Castellón, Spain, during the years 2001–2006. Our modeling approach incorporates spatial covariates as they are useful to model spatial variability and to gain insight about factors related to the presence of forest fires. Such information may be of great utility to predict the spreading of ongoing fires and also to prevent wildfire outburst by controlling risk factors. We describe and take advantage of the Bayesian methodology including Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) and Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) in the modeling process. We present the results of different models fitted to the data and discuss its usefulness to fire managers and planners.},

Our approach makes use of nested thread-level parallelism, a parallel line search procedure using robust regression in INLA’s optimization phase and the state-of-the-art sparse linear solver PARDISO. We leverage mutually independent function evaluations in the algorithm as well as advanced sparse linear algebra techniques. This way we can flexibly utilize the power of today’s multi-core architectures. We demonstrate the performance of our new parallelization scheme on a number of different real-world applications. The introduction of parallelism leads to speedups of a factor 10 and more for all larger models. Our work is already integrated in the current version of the open-source R-INLA package, making its improved performance conveniently available to all users.},

  abstract = {Estimation of stationary dependence structure parameters using only a single realisation of the spatial process, typically leads to inaccurate estimates and poorly identified parameters. A common way to handle this is to fix some of the parameters, or within the Bayesian framework, impose prior knowledge. In many applied settings, stationary models are not flexible enough to model the process of interest, thus non-stationary spatial models are used. However, more flexible models usually means more parameters, and the identifiability problem becomes even more challenging. We investigate aspects of estimation of a Bayesian non-stationary spatial model for annual precipitation using observations from multiple years. The model contains replicates of the spatial field, which increases precision of the estimates and makes them less prior sensitive. Using R-INLA, we analyse precipitation data from southern Norway, and investigate statistical properties of the replicate model in a simulation study. The non-stationary spatial model we explore belongs to a recently introduced class of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) based spatial models. This model class allows for non-stationary models with explanatory variables in the dependence structure. We derive conditions to facilitate prior specification for these types of non-stationary spatial models.},

In time, space, and many other domains, they both imply the same idea: quantities that occur closer together are more similar than those further apart.

Traditionally, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been used to fit these type of models. However, these are highly computationally intensive methods that present a wide range of issues in terms of convergence and can become infeasible in big data problems. The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method is a computational less-intensive alternative to MCMC that allows us to perform approximate Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models such as generalised linear mixed models and spatial and spatio-temporal models. This approach can be used in combination with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to analyse geostatistical data that have been collected at particular sites to predict the spatial process underlying the data as well as to assess the effect of covariates and model other sources of variability. Here we demonstrate how to fit a Bayesian spatial model using the INLA and SPDE approaches applied to freely available data of malaria prevalence and risk factors in Mozambique. We show how to fit and interpret the model to predict malaria risk and assess the effect of covariates using the R-INLA package, and provide the R code necessary to reproduce the results or to use it in other spatial applications.},

We first establish a connection between Lévy flights and PDEs involving the Fractional Laplacian (FL) operator. The corresponding Fokker–Planck PDEs will serve as a basis to propose new generalisations by considering a general form of SPDE with terms accounting for dispersal, drift and reaction. We detail the difference between the FL operator (with or without linear reaction term) associated with a fat-tailed dispersal kernel and therefore describing long-distance dependencies, and the damped FL operator associated with a thin-tailed kernel, thus corresponding to short-distance dependencies. Then, SPDE-based random fields with non-stationary external spatially and temporally varying force are illustrated and nonlinear bistable reaction terms are introduced. The physical meaning of the latter and possible applications are discussed. Returning to the microscopic interpretation of the above-mentioned equations, we describe in a relatively simple case their links with point processes. We unravel the nature of the point processes they generate and show how such mechanistic models, associated to a probabilistic observation model, can be used in a hierarchical setting to estimate the parameters of the particle dynamics.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {The key operation in Bayesian inference is to compute high-dimensional integrals. An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second-order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute, and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

  abstract = {Bayesian whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis with three-dimensional spatial smoothing priors has been shown to produce state-of-the-art activity maps without pre-smoothing the data. The proposed inference algorithms are computationally demanding however, and the proposed spatial priors have several less appealing properties, such as being improper and having infinite spatial range. We propose a statistical inference framework for whole-brain fMRI analysis based on the class of Mat\textbackslash 'ern covariance functions. The framework uses the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) representation of possibly anisotropic spatial Mat\textbackslash 'ern fields via the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach of Lindgren et al. (2011). This allows for more flexible and interpretable spatial priors, while maintaining the sparsity required for fast inference in the high-dimensional whole-brain setting. We develop an accelerated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm for empirical Bayes (EB) inference of the spatial hyperparameters. Conditionally on the inferred hyperparameters, we make a fully Bayesian treatment of the brain activity. The Mat\textbackslash 'ern prior is applied to both simulated and experimental task-fMRI data and clearly demonstrates that it is a more reasonable choice than the previously used priors, using comparisons of activity maps, prior simulation and cross-validation.},

The problem of quality tetrahedral mesh generation is challenged by many theoretical and practical issues. TetGen uses Delaunay-based algorithms which have theoretical guarantee of correctness. It can robustly handle arbitrary complex 3D geometries and is fast in practice. The source code of TetGen is freely available. This article presents the essential algorithms and techniques used to develop TetGen. The intended audience are researchers or developers in mesh generation or other related areas. It describes the key software components of TetGen, including an efficient tetrahedral mesh data structure, a set of enhanced local mesh operations (combination of flips and edge removal), and filtered exact geometric predicates. The essential algorithms include incremental Delaunay algorithms for inserting vertices, constrained Delaunay algorithms for inserting constraints (edges and triangles), a new edge recovery algorithm for recovering constraints, and a new constrained Delaunay refinement algorithm for adaptive quality tetrahedral mesh generation. Experimental examples as well as comparisons with other softwares are presented.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a significant policy change at the local level, which privatized liquor sales and distribution. Specifically, we explored the relationship between alcohol and violence in Seattle, WA, 2010–2013, via hierarchical spatio-temporal disease mapping models. To measure and map this complex spatio-temporal relationship at the census block group level (n=567), we examined a variety of models using integrated nested Laplace approximations and used the deviance information criterion to gauge model complexity and fit. For each additional off-premises and on-premises alcohol outlet in a given census block group, we found a significant increase of 8\% and 5\% for aggravated assaults and 6\% and 5\% for non-aggravated assaults, respectively. Lastly, our maps showed variation in the estimated relative risks across the city of Seattle.},

We show a general approach to construct stationary models related to a wide class of linear SPDEs, with applications to spatio-temporal models having non-trivial properties. Within the framework of Generalized Random Fields, a criterion for existence and uniqueness of stationary solutions for this class of SPDEs is proposed and proven. Their covariance are then obtained through their spectral measure. We present a result relating the covariance of the solution in the case of a White Noise source term with the covariance in a generic case through convolution. Then, we obtain a variety of SPDE-based stationary random fields. In particular, well-known results regarding the Matérn Model and Markovian models are recovered. A new relationship between the Stein model and a particular SPDE is obtained. New spatio-temporal models obtained from evolution SPDEs of arbitrary temporal derivative order are then obtained, for which properties of separability and symmetry can be controlled. We also obtain results concerning stationary solutions for physically inspired models, such as solutions to the heat equation, the advection-diffusion equation, some Langevin’s equations and the wave equation.},

  abstract = {Multivariate models for spatial count data are currently receiving attention in disease mapping to model two or more diseases jointly. They have been thoroughly studied from a theoretical point of view, but their use in practice is still limited because they are computationally expensive and, in general, they are not implemented in standard software to be used routinely. Here, a new multivariate proposal, based on the recently derived M models for spatial data, is developed for spatio-temporal areal data. The model takes account of the correlation between the spatial and temporal patterns of the phenomena being studied, and it also includes spatio-temporal interactions. Though multivariate models have been traditionally fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, here we propose to adopt integrated nested Laplace approximations to speed up computations as results obtained using both fitting techniques were nearly identical. The techniques are used to analyse two forms of crimes against women in India. In particular, we focus on the joint analysis of rapes and dowry deaths in Uttar Pradesh, the most populated Indian state, during the years 2001–2014.},
